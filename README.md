# work_day_scheduler

## Description

I built this project in order to demostrate my understanding of how Third Party API's can be used to make building an application easier. I proved that I was able to successfully link API's to the HTML to dynamically influence the output of the application. 

When building this project I was able to further my understanding of jQuery and Day.js. Both of these concepts will help in my future development of becoming a software engineer. 

## Installation

The application is deployed on GitHub and is available to view.

## Usage

This project is used to organize someones work day (9AM - 5PM). The user can select different hours individually to create a note or task. The application is also color coordinated based on past/present/future times. Once you click the "save" button the task will be saved to local storage. 

## Deployed Application
